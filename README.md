# 🏙️ If Cities Had a UX Designer  
### London vs China Edition

A product thinking case study that treats **cities like digital products** and explores how everyday urban experiences could be redesigned.

This project compares **London** with a selected **Chinese city**, focusing on user journeys, friction points and system design choices that shape how people move, pay, navigate and interact with the city around them.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

To apply product and UX design thinking to real-world urban systems by:

- mapping everyday user journeys  
- identifying friction points for different user groups  
- comparing system behaviours between London and China  
- understanding how digital infrastructure shapes experiences  
- proposing clear, actionable improvements  
- exploring cities through data, design and behavioural insight  

This is not a policy project.  
It is a **PM-style systems analysis** showing how design decisions affect millions of daily interactions.
