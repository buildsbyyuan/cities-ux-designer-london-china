# Overview

This project explores what cities might look like if they were designed with the same principles used in modern product and UX design. By treating the city as a product and the resident as the user, the goal is to understand where everyday friction appears and how better design could improve the overall experience.

The case study focuses on **London** and **Shanghai**, two cities with very different digital ecosystems, transport systems, payment cultures and information flows. By mapping user journeys in both cities, the project highlights:

- how people move through the city  
- how they access services  
- how digital tools support or complicate daily life  
- where users experience friction  
- what design opportunities exist  

This project uses product thinking methods such as user journeys, service blueprints and comparative system analysis. It is not a technical or coding-heavy project. Instead, it showcases structured reasoning, clarity and creativity applied to real-world systems.

The aim is to build a thoughtful, accessible and modern case study that demonstrates how UX design principles can be applied to complex environments like cities.
